optmize the play of the bot for your needs\\n\\nn most cases it may be useful to put the poker client inside a virtual machine to avoid it from interfering\\nwith the bot lso the bot will then be able

as it has more leeway to play or example on a 001002 table buy in more than the minimum of 2 deally start with 4 or even more\\n ook at the strategy analyzer and work your way backwards irst improve

and making a pull request back into the originmastert will be hard for one person alone to beat the world at poker hat'swhy this repo aims to have a collaborative environment where models canbe added and evaluatedo contribute do the following et ycharm and build the virtual python environment se can do pip install r requirementstxt see above lone your fork to your local machine ou can do this directly from pycharm   check out from version control  git dd as remote the original repository where you created the fork from and call it upstream the connection to your fork should be called origin his can be done with vcs  git  remotes reate a new branch click on master at the bottom right and then click on 'new branch' ake your edits nsure all tests pass nder file  settings  python integrated tools switch to pytest ou can then just right click on the tests folder and run all tests ll tests need to pass ake sure to add your own tests by simply naming the funtion test  ake sure all the tests are passing est run pytest as described above in pycharm just right click on the tests folder and run it f a test fails you can debug the test by right clicking on it and put breakpoints or even open a console at the breakpoint httpsstackoverflowcomquestions19329601interactiveshelldebuggingwithpycharm ommit your changes  ush your changes to your origin your fork  o bring your branch up to date with upstream master if it has moved on rebase onto upstream master click on your branch name at the bottom right of pycharm then click on upstreammaster then rebase onto ou may need to resolve soe conflicts nce this is done make sure to always forcepush ctrlshiftk not just push his can be done by selecting the dropdown next to push and choose forcepush important don't push and merge a rebased branch with your remote reate a pull request on your githubcom to merge your branch with the upstream master hen your pull request is approved it will be merged into the upstreammaster lease make sure that all tests are passing including the pylint test ou can either run them locally on your machine or when you push check the travis log on github currently many are failing feel free to help fixing themo top left corner ake sure everything looks exactly like in the picture at the top of this documentation     he buttons need to look exactly like this and it needs to be in nglish and not scaled olours need to be standard     ost tables are mapped to real money hey won't work with play money     he poker table window has to be fully visible and cannot be scaled otherwise it won't be detected properly     n artypoker when you open the table choose table options and then choose back to default size to make sure the table is in default size ables are mapped for fast forward and zoom games with real money se the upersonic3 table for artypoker or caught table in okerstars f things still don't work consider teaching it a new table as described aboveards not recognized ake sure everything looks exactly like in the picture at the top of this documentation     ake sure to use real money ables are different for play money     nsure you are seated at the position as shown in the picture above     urrently the bot only works for tables with 6 playerso  need to use a virtual machine or okerstars you definitely do otherwise you will be blocked and your account will be frozen within minutes or artypoker 'm not sure ut best check the terms and conditionsnalyzing the log and reporting problems n the folder where you installed the pokerbot there is a subfolder with the log files in log here are also screenshots in logscreenshots that may be able to help debug the problem reate a issue on the link at the top of this github page httpsgithubcomdickreuterokerissues or email
