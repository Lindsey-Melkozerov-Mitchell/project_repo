optmize the play of the bot for your needs\\n\\nn most cases it may be useful to put the poker client inside a virtual machine to avoid it from interfering\\nwith the bot lso the bot will then be able

hands played with a strategy to draw any conclusions ven better 5000 hands nything less than 1000 hands is completely random\\n est buy in more than the minimum this will improve the bots performance as it has more leeway to play or example on a 001002 table buy in more than the minimum of 2 deally start with 4 or even more\\n ook at the strategy analyzer and work your way backwards irst improve the iver play then once this is good move on to the urn then to the lop etc his is because the game is path dependent\\n f you make changes in the ranges you may need to adapt all minimum equities as

a name for your template for example okerstars 12 zoom poker lick on 'lank new'\\n ow the first think you want to do is to take a screenshot of the pokerstars window with the table ou can do this by pressing on the ake screenshot button ou should not see in the lower window a full screenshot of what is on your screen\\n he first step is now to mark the top left corner of the poker tables window which will be the point of reference for everything else that will follow o mark the top left corner you need to mark it by first clicking on the top left part of it and then on the right lower part of it once you have done this it will appear in the second window ou can save it by clicking on the save newly selected top left corner button\\n ow you can crop it by pressing on the crop from top left corner button his will discard most of the screenshot and only keep the screenshot from the top left corner and everything a few hundred pixels to the right of it and below\\n ext you will want to mark everything else in the window tart with the uttons search area ou can do this again by clicking on the top left area of the buttons and then on the bottom right area of where the buttons

not scaled olours need to be standard     ost tables are mapped to real money hey won't work with play money     he poker table window has to be fully visible and cannot be scaled otherwise it won't be detected properly     n artypoker when you open the table choose table options and then choose back to default size to make sure the table is in default size ables are mapped for fast forward and zoom games with real money se the upersonic3 table for artypoker or caught table in okerstars f things still don't work consider teaching it a new table as described aboveards not recognized ake sure everything looks exactly like in the picture at the top of this documentation     ake sure to use real money ables are different for play money     nsure you are seated at the position as shown in the picture above     urrently the bot only works for tables with 6 playerso  need to use a virtual machine or okerstars you definitely do otherwise you will be blocked and your account will be frozen within minutes or artypoker 'm not sure ut best check the terms and conditionsnalyzing the log and reporting problems n the folder where you installed the pokerbot there is a subfolder with the log files in log here are also screenshots in logscreenshots that may be able to help debug the problem reate a issue on the link at the top of this github page httpsgithubcomdickreuterokerissues or email
